"""
1. Clean up wrong X and Y values (very few of them)
2. visualize data.
2. Parse input to get features: for e.g: get date, time, year, month, etc..)
3. Select, and generate features.
3. Remove outliers.
4. do PCA

Output: train dataframe with features and labels column
        test dataframe with features and lables column
        visuals to provide insights on data that help select, and tune the models.
